			<h2><span>Case Study:</span><span>PayScale App</span></h2>

			<h3>Overview</h3>
			<h4 class="sub-head">The Need</h4>

			<p>This is a visual representation of the compensation that women of different races make compared to white men.</p> 

			<p>At the top of this graphic, we see color-coded dollar bills showing the equivalent amount earned for women of a particular race compared to the amount earned by white men.</p>

			<p>At the bottom of this graphic is a color-coded calendar that correlates to the color-coded dollars above. This calendar is showing how far into the following year women of a particular race have to work in order to earn the equivalent of white men.</p>

			<h3>Why is this Happening?</h3>
			<h4 class="sub-head">Generative Research</h4>

			<p>Through my generative research, I found there are many large issues contributing to the gender wage gap including:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Gender discrimination in the workplace.</li>
				<li>Jobs that are typically stereotyped as female or feminine tend to be devalued.</li>
				<li>Having a family makes women less attractive hires, while making men more attractive hires.</li>
			</ul>

			​<p>Women often don’t negotiate salaries for fear of being iced out in their jobs, leading to a widening year-over-year pay gap.
			Women are more likely to be hired for lower-paying jobs, while being vastly underrepresented in high-paying jobs.</p>

			<p>For this project, I decided to focus on women negotiating their salary at the start of a new job, and negotiating for a promotion or raise.</p>

			<h4>Things to Consider</h4>

			<p>Even though women have increased their presence in higher-paying jobs traditionally dominated by men, such as professional and managerial positions, women as a whole continue to be overrepresented in lower-paying occupations.</p>

			<h3>Qualitative Research</h3>

			<p>For my evaluative research, I interviewed 5 women who work full-time, with an age-range of mid-30’s to early 50’s, some married with kids and some married without kids.</p>
			<p>I wanted to dig deep into the issue and understand how their lives both at work and at home are impacted by the gender wage gap.</p>

			<p>Some of my interview questions include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><q>Tell me what you know about how your salary rate was determined when you were hired.</q></li>
				<li><q>What kind of support do you receive from leaders in the workplace?</q></li>
				<li><q>Tell me about a time that you had to negotiate your salary.</q></li>
			</ul>
